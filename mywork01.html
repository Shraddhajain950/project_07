   <p class="para">Be U is a content library for streaming videos, movies and playing fun developmental games for kids. 
  As kids we are often told stories and seen movies in which they show how a princess or prince looks a certain way. And as kids when we grow up we tend to believe that if they don’t look like their superhero or princess they cannot be them. The Media today ends up creating unrealistic expectations of main characters and kids tend to believe those.  
 
  BeU is a content library that helps kids understand and learn about different culture by watching movies of different culture.The app contains a collection of movies and videos that are about superheroes of different culture and also about different countries.
  It focuses on educating kids to help them to understand that you don’t have to look a certain way or be a particular way to be something. This helps kids to be more empathetic towards diverse culture and also help them learn it is okay to be different. 
  The app is designed to encourage our primary users who are kids between age of 0 -11 yrs to view content that is diversity inclusive which teaches and educates the kids about people of different culture and ethnicities and help the kids to be more empathetic and open to different cultures.</p>
